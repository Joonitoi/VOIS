# Goal and motivation
The goal of the project was to implement a protcol for text based communication over TCP in realtime. 
The motivation behind the project was to assist in an essay investigating the role of anonymity and information exchange in a society. This essay was referenced as a *proof of concept* for technology made accessible for anyone to freely exchange information.
The project also attempted to answer the question regarding the importance of open source projects and how it affects security in deployed applications.
